    <h1>CPSC332 HW1</h1>

    <p>I decided to take CPSC332 to learn more about web development, 
        specifically, full stack web development and what exactly that means. 
        Further, I would like to begin learning about <em>JavaScript</em> and 
        it's differences from languages I already know like C++ & Python. By the 
        end of this course I hope I can <strong>create my own webpage</strong> 
        which I can show friends and family and use my new knowledge in conjuction
        with other programming languages I already know to craft better side 
        projects</p>
