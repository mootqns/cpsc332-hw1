    <h1>CPSC332 HW1</h1>
    <p>I decided to take CPSC332 to learn more about web development
        , specifically full stack web development. Further, I would like
        to begin learning about JavaScript and it's differences from
        languages I already know like C++ & Python. By the end of this
        course I hope I can create my own webpage which I can show friends
        and family.</p>
